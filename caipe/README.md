# CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering)

> 💡 Tip: CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering), pronounced like cape (as in a superhero cape 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️). Just as a 🦸‍♂️ cape empowers a superhero, CAIPE empowers platform engineers with 🤖 Agentic AI automation! 🚀

Community AI Platform Engineering (CAIPE) (pronounced as cape) is an open-source, Multi-Agentic AI System (MAS) championed by the CNOE (Cloud Native Operational Excellence) forum. CAIPE provides a secure, scalable, persona-driven reference implementation with built-in knowledge base retrieval that streamlines platform operations, accelerates workflows, and fosters innovation for modern engineering teams. It integrates seamlessly with Internal Developer Portals like Backstage and developer environments such as VS Code, enabling frictionless adoption and extensibility.
